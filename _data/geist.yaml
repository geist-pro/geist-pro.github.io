about: |
  Geist is a research lab at the Keio Graduate School of Media Design, Keio University Japan, as well as a loosely connected collective of individuals driven by the same ideals.
  
  Geist (pronunciation: [ˈɡaɪst] ) is a German word. Depending on context, it can be translated as the English words mind, spirit, or ghost. It loosely refers to "Ghost in the Shell" and to "Ghost in the Machine", a term coined by Gilbert Ryle. "Ghost in the Machine" shows the absurdity of the mind-body dualism.
  
  Knowledge and wisdom are not merely functional, there's enjoyment in understanding the world. The Sense of Wonder refers the awe we feel when we understand a new concept, a mechanism etc. When we gain a deep understanding of something, it often fills us with satisfaction and amazement. Imagine a child's experience. Every little insight it gains from interacting with the world makes it excited.
  
  In Geist we use technology to understand ourselves and our world better. Our passion is increasing the human potential using technology: To "Amplify the Sense of Wonder".
