    In an increasingly interconnected world, and with a greater flow of information, more people are having problems with keeping attention and focus. Attention is a finite resource, and we need to use it smartly. We need new tools to better manage our attention, to improve our collective intelligence. There are patterns in human physiological signals (facial expressions, heart rate, nose temperature, eye movements, blinks etc.) that can reveal information about intentions and cognitive functions of an individuals and groups. So far, this data is only heavily exploited by advertisement and marketing companies. This projects aims at exploring these patterns using an Open Eyewear Platform to better understand our behavior. So, people can optimize for their own personal and society goals. We see this as an integral first step to democratize Big Personal Data and giving the user more control over their lives, living with greater awareness and intention, and giving people more power to achieving their potential. We need better tools for personal and society introspection.

    In this project, we work on an Open Eyewear Platform, a toolset to quantify social and cognitive functions of individuals and groups of people in real life settings using physiological sensing (e.g. eye movements, blink patterns, facial expressions etc.). After we can quantify these social and cognitive functions, we are designing interactions/ interventions to improve behavior. 

    Why Eyewear? As humans receive most of their sensory input via the head, it is a particularly interesting body location for sensing and interaction especially for tracking and enhancing social and cognitive functions. In contrast to Google Glass and early wearable system approaches that just attached devices to standard glasses, we envision exploiting smart eyeglasses for assistance applications through fully integrated sensing, processing, and interaction functions in the regular spectacles design, thus maximizing unobtrusiveness.

    We work  on how: 
    (1) To quantify social and cognitive functions using sensors embedded in unobtrusive eyewear to better understand our behavior 
    (2) to visualize this data to provide insights to individuals and groups about their behavior and to design interventions to improve behavior and effectiveness based on your personal goals.
    (3) To make an Open Eyewear toolset available to individuals.

    This project is interdisciplinary research focusing on the use of patterns in physiological signals to quantify and improve our daily behavior using a smart glasses design. We assess the link between behavior patterns/physiological signals and social/cognitive functions using specialized medical hardware (ground truth) and we quantify them in real life (from the lab to everyday). In a second step, we explore interactions to improve behavior: learn smarter, work smarter, live smarter.

  title: Experiential Supplements
  description: |
    Sharing experiences and knowledge have always been essential for human development. They enable skill transfers and empathy. Over history, mankind developed from oral traditions to cultures of writing. With the ongoing digital revolution, the hurdles to share knowledge and experiences vanish.  Already today it is, for example, technically feasible to take and store 24/7 video recordings of one's’ life. While this example creates massive collections of data, it makes it even more challenging to share experiences and knowledge with others in meaningful ways.

    A recurring theme in science fiction literature is the download of the abilities of another human to one's mind. Although current cognitive science and neuroscience strongly suggest that this is impossible, as our minds are embodied; we believe that skill transfer and effective learning will accelerate tremendously given recent technological trends; just to name a few of the enabling technologies, human augmentation using virtual/augmented reality, new sensing modalities (e.g. affective computing) and actuation (e.g. haptics), advances in immersive storytelling (increasing empathy, immersion, communication)  etc. 

    Most of the problems we face in our life have already been experienced and solved by others. In this project, we want to digitally recording experiences,  extract the essence and store them to make them applicable to other people. In this process, we transform the digital record of experiences into a user-adapted form called “experiential supplement” taking into account users’ cognitive states. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the above process in the fields of learning, health care, sports and entertainment.

  title: Deep Learning the Human Mind

    This project is about estimating cognitive performance fluctuations through deep learning, using a combination of physiological signals and recorded behavior patterns as data. Rather than employing deep learning to mimic or surpass some human cognitive functions (such as visual object/face recognition, playing Go, etc.), we adopt a human-empowering framework and use deep learning to “learn deeply” about the human mind.
